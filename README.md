# React Tic Tac Toe with Vite

This repository contains a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React. It served as my introduction to React, as I followed along with the tutorial on [react.dev](https://react.dev). The game showcases basic concepts of React including components, state, and props.

## Setup

The project was bootstrapped with Vite to benefit from its faster HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and leaner development experience.

### Official Vite Plugins for React:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

For this project, I utilized [specify which plugin you used, e.g., "@vitejs/plugin-react"] to ensure the best development experience.

## Running the Game

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:[whatever it says on your terminal]` to play the game!

## Feedback

As this was my first React project, I'm open to feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
